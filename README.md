# Perfect Pitch Ear – Javascript WebApp

This webApp will help you to train your perfect pitch ear to identify the musical notes only by it's sound.

## Description
This is a simple webApp written in Javascript to run inside a browsers web page and it will help you train your perfect pitch ear. It plays a piano sound that you try to identify. When the answer is correct you will ear the piano sound again to reinforce your memory. The correct musical note also appears in the staff. With it you will learn almost all notes of the most used 4 octaves.
The principal technique used in this App is the fact that you can stack div’s tag’s containing image objects inside them. An outer boundary div is created and then inner div’s with absolute position inside them are stacked.
The images are all SVG’s (Scaled Vector Graphics)..
